X-Mode Social, Inc. collects and passes to third parties a variety of information for use as described below:
<br>
<h4>What's Collected:</h4>
Precise location information (such as your device GPS coordinates), relative location information (from WiFi signals or Bluetooth Low Energy devices in your proximity, for example), device-based advertising identifiers, information about your mobile device such as type of device, operating system version and type, device settings, time zone, carrier and IP address. 
 
<h4>When We Collect It:</h4>  

When the app is in use or running in the background.  
 
<h4>How We Use and Share It:</h4>   

We and other third parties may use the information (a) to customize ads in this or other apps (for instance, if your device is often located at or near music venues, you might receive offers for music tickets); (b) to measure effectiveness of those ads, or (c) for market, civic or other research regarding aggregated traffic patterns (for instance, a company that analyzes shopping trends might want to learn whether more or fewer devices are seen near malls or in other shopping districts). 
 
<h4>How To Opt Out:</h4>
To opt-out of X-Mode's data collection, (1) follow the instructions in <a href="https://xmode.io/privacy-policy.html">X-Mode's Privacy Policy</a>, or (2) for a platform-based opt-out of interest-based or "personalized" advertising, go to your device settings and opt out of interest-based or personalized advertising (iOS: Settings -> General -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Limit Ad-Tracking).  You may also prevent location from being collected by this or other apps through your location permission settings.
